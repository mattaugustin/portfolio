Welcome !     
This directory provides select examples of code I have written in the last few years. This covers manipulating of small and large datasets, deriving diverse physics-related parameters, conducting data analysis, visualizing results in a clear and eye-appealing fashion, as well as producing maps and manipulating several spatial objects. Most of the code is written in R, but sequences in Octave (~Matlab) and SAC (Seismic Analysis Code) are also available.


### **Kriging** (R code)   
The purpose is to obtain a higher resolution national hazard map covering the entire territory. Using earthquake acceleration data defined at the nodes of a regularly-spaced grid covering the United Kingdom, this project shows the steps leading to smoothing of said data over the land by means of kriging technique. This work combines reshaping dataframes and manipulating spatial objects (polygons, dataframe ...).
    
### Spectra (Octave)          
A code written to compute, plot and save spectral values (acceleration, velocity and displacement) based on an externally-read earthquake signal. This code served as a basis when ported into R when treating earthquake signals at scale (see Seismic_records or NDSHA folders), but offers faster performance when working with many structural periods.

### **Tracker** (Octave)            
A tracker which calculates and plots the projected position of beam particles across several user-defined locations along a beamline, ultimately providing insights on the performances of a high resolution mass spectrometry setup.


### Predictions vs Observations   
One trend in earthquake engineering is, rather than "waiting" for strong earthquakes to strike and gathering seismic acceleration data (seismograms, accelerograms) for use in various fields, how about artifically "generating" these signals using equations related to the physics of seismic fault rupture and wave propagation ? This would be ideal, for as long as the artificially generated signals can faithfully enough reproduce the signals recorded during actual earthquakes. In other words, how well do artificial signals compare to real signals, based on several engineering metrics associated to earthquake-induced ground shaking ?
This 4-part project aims at assessing the performance of the NDSHA, one technique that generates artificial earthquake signals tailored to a region of interest (ex: UK), relying on the Modal Summation method. This technique was chosen among others owing to the little amount of geophysical & seismological data required in the model implementation. The earthquake signals were generated by yours truly, using Fortran codes proprietary of the Geophysics Dept of the University of Trieste, Italy.


+ **Predictions vs Observations I : SAC**  (SAC code)      
Earthquake signals recorded by seismic monitoring stations are frequently made available in so-called SAC format, requiring the use of Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) for their handling. Using RAW seismic data from stations operated during a recent earthquake, this work shows code routines for reading, identifying, treating, plotting and exporting suitably processed SAC signals and could be easily modified to handle additional settings (station number, filtering, different earthquakes).
  

+ **Predictions vs Observations II : Seismic_records** (R code)       
This project is the next logical step upon pre-processing the SAC signals. Such SAC signals are read into R code in order to extract common engineering earthquake parameters such as PGA and PGV or to derive more complex parameter such as spectral accelerations over a range of structural periods and Arias intensity, with relevant plots illustrating the entire sequence.
This routine can directly follow from the SAC-based codes presented in directory /SAC, or be applied to other (already processed) SAC files.


+ **Predictions vs Observations III : NDSHA** (R code)           
In this project, a dataset of synthetic earthquake seismograms generated by the NDSHA methology are read into and processed using R code, in order to extract and derive selected earthquake engineering parameters. The code shows how to incorporate the large dataset by means of a tree structure that allows to keep track of the several relevant simulation settings and parameters.


+ **Predictions vs Observations IV : Residuals**  (R code)              
This section is the final stage upon obtaining engineering parameters from seismic records (=observations) and from predictions (=simulated synthetic signals). The large prediction dataset is validated against observations using a residual analysis and then relying on various ggplot-based visualisations, which shows how performing the predictive model behaves. Plots are also utilised to assess the impact of other parameters/settings involved in deriving predictions and observations.
