***In a nutshell :*** *I created this code to obtain engineering parameters from synthetic earthquake signals (i.e. time histories) produced by the MS technique as featured in the NDSHA methodology (Panza 2001, 2012). The code reads and processes a large dataset of earthquake signals, calculating the parameters using a set of functions and keeping track of the range of settings associated to the simulations. I included several plotting options to clearly visualize the data and results. The final output is a dataframe containing seismic parameters derived from simulations that can be compared to earthquake observation data in a companion project section.*




The steps are as follows : 
+ creating functions for later operations (Arias Intensity, spectral accelerations, dataframe and list re-organizing),
+ preparing the file architecture for subsequent reading, 
+ reading and processing dataframe, 
+ creating a Tree Structure for organizing the files, 
+ processing files to extract relevant earthquake parameters such as PGA, spectral acceleration values, Arias-intensity related parameters,
+ plotting parameters related to earthquake events.



An example dataset with earthquake signals corresponding to different events, recording channels and stations is provided at the following link:

A Tree Structure was decided from the onset, owing to the fact that acceleration data for each earthquake simulation (*.plt files) do not contain any metadata such as earthquake realisation number, event, directivity or station ID. The signals were therefore created using a tree structure holding such info using the directory and sub-directory names (ex: bil000/quake_dudley_Bchan/real01/). Signals were then read into R and processed following the same tree pattern.
  In terms of tree structure and how it connects to simulation processes, for each earthquake event and corresponding recording stations, 99 realisations of earthquake fault rupture are simulated for each of the 3 directivity angles 0, 90 and 180 degrees. In this code, as an example, only 3 realisations (instead of 99) for each of directivity angle are considered, and earthquake signals correspond to 4 separate seismic events, each of which recorded on 3 different stations.
